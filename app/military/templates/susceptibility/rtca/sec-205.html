From 4 GHz to 18 GHz, use the appropriate pulse modulated (PM) test level with a 1 &micro;s pulse width (or greater) and 1 kHz pulse repetition frequency. Especially consider switching the signal on and off at a 1 Hz rate and 50% duty cycle for an EUT which may have a low frequency response (e.g. flight control equipment)</li>

            For <mark>all categories</mark>: Above 1 GHz it is permissible to use SW modulation at 1.42 times the CW field strength requirement to satisfy both CW and SW requirements simultaneously (e.g. 142 V/m SW, 50% duty cycle to qualify 100 V/m CW and SW).
