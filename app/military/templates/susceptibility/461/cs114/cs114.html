                    This requirement is applicable from 10 kHz to 200 MHz for all interconnecting cables, including
                    power cables. For EUTs intended to be installed on ships or submarines, an additional common mode
                    limit of 77 dBμA is applicable from 4 kHz to 1 MHz on complete power cables (highs and returns -
                    common mode test).

                    The EUT shall not exhibit any malfunction, degradation of performance, or deviation from specified
                    indications beyond the tolerances indicated in the individual equipment or subsystem specification,
                    when subjected to an injection probe drive level which has been pre-calibrated to the appropriate
                    current limit shown on Figure CS114-1 and is modulated as specified below.<br>
                    The appropriate limit curve on Figure CS114-1 shall be selected from Table VI. Requirements are also
                    met if the EUT is not susceptible at forward power levels sensed by the directional coupler that are
                    below those determined during calibration provided that the actual current induced in the cable
                    under test is <mark>Curve 5 = 115 dBµA, Curve 4 = 103 dBµA, Curve 3 = 95 dBµA, Curve 2 = 89 dBµA and
                        Curve 1 = 83 dBµA</mark> across the frequency range.<br>
                    The requirement is not applicable for coaxial cables to antenna ports of antenna-connected receivers
                    except for surface ships and submarines.

                            the modulation is present on the drive signal for each signal generator/modulation source
                            combination. Ensure that the modulation frequency, waveform and depth (40 dB minimum from
                            peak to baseline) are correct.</li>
                        <li>Apply the forward power level determined under 5.12.3.4b(4) to the injection probe while
                            monitoring the induced current. For shielded cables or low impedance circuits, it may be
                            preferable to increase the signal gradually to limit the current.</li>
                        <li>Scan the required frequency range in accordance with 4.3.10.4.1 and Table III while
                            maintaining the forward power level at the calibration level determined under 5.12.3.4b(4),
                            or the maximum current level for the applicable limit, whichever is less stringent.</li>
                        <li>Monitor the EUT for degradation of performance during testing.</li>
                        <li>Whenever susceptibility is noted, determine the threshold level in accordance with
                            4.3.10.4.3.</li>
                        <li> For EUTs with redundant cabling for safety critical reasons such as multiple data buses,
                            use simultaneous multi-cable injection techniques.</li>
